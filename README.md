# Topic2_R_Introduction
Tutorial and basics: The idea is that you should install R and get familiarized with basic operations.

1. Tutorials web

- I would try one (or maybe both): http://tryr.codeschool.com/ and http://data.princeton.edu/R . Both start with the basic concepts of programming in R.

- Youtube is also a great source to find teaching pages or even complete courses.

- Rstudio is a free platform I recommend for both writing and running R.

- A final great idea is to google "do XXX in R". In my experience the best answers are located on stackoverflow.com, which is a site where programmers add info to be helpul.

2. Texts

- I recommend starting with this one: "R in a Nutshell"
